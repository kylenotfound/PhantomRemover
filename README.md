# PhantomRemover
Removes Phantoms from Minecraft, while still allowing players to obtain their drops.

I personally can't stand phantoms. They look super cool but are a pain, so I wrote this to remove them on my server.

### Pros:
* You can still obtain phantom membrane through Drowned Zombies and Striders
* No more phantoms

### Cons:
* You can't get the achievement 'Two Birds, One Arrow'

% Breakdown for Phantom Membrane Drops.
* With a fist: 0%
* With any other item 5%
* Sword with Looting 1: 10% for 1 membrane
* Sword with Looting 2: 20% for 2 membrane, 10% for one membrane
* Sword with Looting 3: 30% for 3 membrane, 20% for 2 membrane, 10% for 1 membrane

## Instalation
> Download the PhantomRemover.jar from this repositiory

> Move the .jar into the /plugins directory at the root of your server. 
If you don't have one, make sure your server is running bukkit, spigot, paper, etc. Then create a /plugins folder, and move the jar into it.

> As an OP run /reload in game. Or restart your server.
